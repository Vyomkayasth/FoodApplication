# FoodApplication

A React + Vite project aimed at **learning how to fetch data from external APIs** and present it in a responsive, dynamic UI.

---

##  Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to deepen understanding of how React interacts with external data sources—particularly APIs—through practical experience with real-world requests and asynchronous logic.

---

##  What I Learn

- Integrating and consuming external APIs in a React environment
- Managing async data flow with `fetch`, `axios`, or similar tools
- Displaying lists, cards, or details based on fetched data
- Handling loading states, errors, and conditional rendering
- Basics of state management with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)

---

##  Tech Stack & Prerequisites

- **Core Technologies**:  
  - React (via [Vite])  
  - JavaScript (ES6+)  
  - ESLint for linting and code quality  
- **Prerequisites**:  
  - Node.js (LTS recommended)  
  - npm or yarn

##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vyomkayasth/FoodApplication.git
    cd FoodApplication
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Visit the local URL (typically `http://localhost:3000`) shown in the terminal to view your app in action.

##  Suggested Learning Steps

1. **Pick an external API** to work with—like a public recipe, food, or nutrition API.
2. Use `fetch()` or `axios` to call the API from a component.
3. Store the response data in state using `useState`.
4. Render UI components dynamically based on API data.
5. Add user interaction (e.g., search inputs, filters).
6. Handle loading and error states gracefully.
7. Clean up code and consider abstracting API logic into services or custom hooks.
